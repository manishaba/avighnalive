                            <p>Packaging is an important segment in the food industry, as it serves multiple purposes for businesses such as not just food handling, preservation and safety but also marketing and branding. Packed has become an essential part of the food processing industry today. Tin Mill Products are extensively used in food packaging by the food processing industries to make different types of containers like cans, open trays, aerosol containers, caps, closures, lids, etc. Avighna Steel Pvt. Ltd. , is leading Processor and Distributor of Tin Mill Products raw materials used for manufacturing of Cans and Containers which are further used for packaging of Edible Foods, Beverages , Chemicals , Paints and Enamels, Oil and Lubricants, FMCG Products and many more. Tin Mill Products consists of Tin Plates , Tin free and Black Plate Coils/ Sheets which are manufactured through coating of Tin / Chrome metal over the Lighter gauge Cold Rolled Coils ( 0.14-0.49 mm , MR grade ). Tin and Chrome coating is done as both these metals are passive , inert and non reactive to most of natural and synthetic chemicals therefore considered best to preserve the food contents and other sensitive chemicals for longer time .</p>
